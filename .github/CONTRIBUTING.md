# Note

Personal portfolio project - not an active open-source effort.

Feel free to fork for your own research. If you spot bugs or have questions, open an issue or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszsolis/).

No formal contribution process - this is my learning/demo project, not production code.
